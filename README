mpdnotify - 'Now Playing' information via notify-send
-----------------------------------------------------

[1] - Synopsis
'mpdnotify' is a simple bash script that uses notify-send
and mpc to create notifications about what song is currently
playing in mpd.

[2] - Requirements (* = optional)
 - mpd
 - mpc
 - notify-send (libnotify)
 - standard UNIX tools (find, egrep, head)
 * ImageMagick (convert)

[3] - Download

Fetch the script with git
 - git clone git://github.com/KindOfAutomatic/mpdnotify.git

Or use wget
 - wget https://github.com/KindOfAutomatic/mpdnotify/raw/master/mpdnotify

[4] - Usage
Configure the script by editing the 'mpdnotify' file.

The only thing left to do is to set up a program that will run
the script whenever a new song is playing.
I use the 'execute_on_song_change' option in 'ncmpcpp' in order to do that.

You could - for example - also employ a simple lua script in case you are
using awesome wm (awesome.naquadah.org).

In order to display cover art, you need to tell 'mpdnotify' where your music
directory is. The script will then look for image files in the directory that
contains the currently playing track.

The default regex expressions for cover art identification will match:
(front|cover|art).(jpg|jpeg|png) [case insensitive]

Before being passed to notify-send, every cover is resized with ImageMagick
according to the geometry given in the corresponding setting.

[5] - Logfile
To prevent mpdnotify from spamming output to the invoking program, any
output from both convert and notify-send is sent to "$HOME/.mpdnotify.log"
by default (this can be changed in the configuration section of the
script).

[6] - Screenshot
See 'mpdnotify.png' for a screenshot. Because notify-send will look
different depending on the window manager (etc.), this screenshot is
only an example and shows mpdnotify using awesome wm with the zenburn
theme.

[7] - License
You can use, edit and redistribute this script in any way you like.
